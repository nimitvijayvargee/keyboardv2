# keyboardv2

A second version of my original keyboard I designed during Hackpad V2. This keyboard follows a slight variation of the ANSI-75 Layout and is coded with QMK and and customizable with VIAL.
The keyboard deviates from my original design by implementing RGB and embracing the plate-less design. The keyboard has per-key RGB thanks to the SK6812-Mini-e Inverted LED.
